#### dot
> the bash function that helps me maintain this repo

dot is defined in `plugin/dot.plugin.sh`. its a small shell script with little user validation `:p`.

config's assets are organized by dot in the following dirs...
* **config** -- the dotfiles 
* **bin** -- the executable files  (added to `$PATH`)
* **plugin** --  the bash scripts that should be sourced by interative shell
