# SLUGBYTE TOOLS

bash config and tools 

the dot utility is for managing my system config. its a small shell script with little user validation `:p`.

assets are organized in the following dirs...
* **config** -- dot files 
* **bin** -- executable files 
* **plugin** -- bash scripts that should be sourced by interative shell

bin is added to `$PATH`.

`git clone git@github.com:slugbyte/config.git $HOME/workspace/config`
